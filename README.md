# VS Code Prettier Eslint

 Visual Studio Extension to format JavaScript code using [prettier-eslint](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-eslint) package.  
 
Once installed it, open a JavaScript file and press `CTRL + CMD + P` (maSOs) or  `CTRL + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) to manually format a file or a selection of code. If you donâ€™t want to format your file manually every time, you can format it on save as well.
## Setup Format on Save
- Open user settings
  - On Windows/Linux - File > Preferences > Settings
  - On macOS - Code > Preferences > Settings
- Search for "Format On " and enable "Format on Save".
- Ensure both "Format on Input" and "Format on Paste" are disabled. They are not supported functionality. 
- Afterward, the file should format automatically once you save it. 

## Settings:
These are global settings. Support for workspace settings is coming soon. Workspace settings allow the settings below to have different values per project.
